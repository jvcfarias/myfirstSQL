<h1> My first SQL</h1>

Hey! I'm Jo√£o Victor Farias! :smile:

The main goal here was to put into practice the manipulation and creation of data bases. 

The data itself included the variables **name**, **gender**, **birth** and the primary key **id**. The knowledge acquired from this one makes it possible to make selections, delete data, alter them and make certain early assessments to see patterns and futurely make statistical assertions and analyses. 

This was my first SQL attempt, using phpmyadmin. I would love to hear any feedback. Thanks!
